# The-Sharpe-Ratio

William F. Sharpe introduced the reward-to-variability ratio (Now called The Sharpe Ratio), which compares the return of an investment to its risk. The Sharpe Ratio's numerator is the difference over time between realized or expected gains and a benchmark (or risk-free rate of return). The Sharpe Ratio divides a portfolio's excess returns from the benchmark by a measure of its volatility to measure risk-adjusted performance. A higher Sharpe Ratio means that the reward will be greater for a given unit of risk.

In this project, I will be calculating something similar to the Sharpe Ratio, known as the Information Ratio. Instead of using a risk-free return as a benchmark (such as U.S. Treasury Securities), I will be using the S&P 500 as a benchmark. I will be calculating the Information Ratios of Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) to see whether they outperform just putting money into the S&P 500, and if so, which is the better of the two.
